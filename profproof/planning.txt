Make a class that represents an expression
	Expression can be a name
	Or expression can a function operating on two other expressions
	Let expressions test for equality
	Let expressions be converted to LaTeX string
	Let expresssions have a way to access the children expressions
	Let expressions have a way to get the basic proposition names
	Let expressions be able to be evaluated given state

Encode a rule relating expressions

Check to see if expression fits rule,
	start at top of expression tree
	see if operator is equal,
	let the first time a name is used in a rule define the name
	and each subsequent time references that name

Store implied statements if not already there

Iterate until found

First I tested with a truth table to prove
