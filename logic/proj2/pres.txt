What is Turing Machine
	idealized computer
	used by Maths
	not practical
	but helps us know what is and isn't computable
How do work?
	tape
	head
	alphabet (programmer)
	states (programmer)
	rules (programmer):
		input state
		input read
		output write (overwrite)
		output movement
		output new state
Letz program
	search for letter
		go through states
		recursion
	decrement
		binary subtraction rules
		recursion/carry
Letz test it
	search for letter
	which rule applies?
	...
	which rule applies?
	add
