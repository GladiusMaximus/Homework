\item The speaker is a knight and a troll.

If I'm a knave, since I said: ``he's a knight or I'm a knave.'', but I always lie, then it must be false, therefore ``It is false that he's a knight and I'm a knave'' By Demorgan's law (changing or to and), we rewrite this as ``He's not a knight and I'm not a knave.'' I m a knave, therefore this line of reasoning is contradictory. I am not a knave.
