Logic Homework
==============

I took [Charlie Barnes' Logic, Reasoning, and
Proofs](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/home). I completed the
course the Fall semester of 2012, and it was great! It is based on his textbook
which can be found
[here](https://sites.google.com/site/barneslogicf13/materials) along with other
course material.

Machine Learning
================

I am working on the homework from Andrew Ng's [machine learning course on
Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005). I am using IPython Notebooks in
combination with the NumPy rather than Octave, which the instructor uses. I
invite the reader to compare both programming languages and decide for
himself/herself which one is more agreeable.

Digital Signal Processing
=========================

I am reworking some homework from [Digital Signal Processing]
(https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004) on Coursera. They use IPython Notebooks,
as well as I.
