Coursera homework
-----------------

Machine Learning
================
I am working on the homework from Andrew Ng's [machine learning course on
Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005). I am using IPython Notebooks in
combination with the NumPy rather than Octave, which the instructor uses. I
invite the reader to compare both programming languages and decide for
himself/herself which one is more agreeable.

Digital Signal Processing
=========================
I am reworking some homework from [Digital Signal Processing]
(https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004) on Coursera. They use IPython Notebooks,
as well as I.
